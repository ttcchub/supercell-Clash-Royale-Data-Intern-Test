About the Data
The database contains three tables: account, account_date_session and iap_purchase.
account contains user profiles, iap_purchase contains in-app purchases by the users, and
account_date_session contains the number of sessions for the users for the days they
have been active. All the tables contain data for the year of 2016.
You can access the SQLite3 database by command line interface sqlite3. There are also
libraries for R and python.
We’d prefer that you complete the assignment using SQL, R, and/or python but feel free to
use any tools that you think are suitable for the job. The only criteria is still that the plots
you do should be reproducible with the code you are writing.
We will assess the visualisation based on clarity and readability, and your conclusions
based on actionability and insightfulness.
The Questions
1. Give us short description of datasets.
2. Analyse the daily active users:
•
 Compare DAU changes over time.
•
 Can you identify any trends in data?
•
 Can you find any ups or drops that are out of the normal behaviour?
•
 What do you think why do they happen?
3. Analyse sales:
•
 Analyse the geographic split of the revenue and the users.
•
 Calculate average revenue per user per market.
•
 What are your observations of the results?
```

## Extra contex

- Quite sure they are fine with this being shared with the "public".
  - was accessible to the public in the first place.
  - their LinkedIn account commented on a post made by one of the candidates with his solution.
- The end result was supposed to be the report itself, even though graphs had to be generated via a programming language.
  - I was adjusting graphs or whatnot on the go - not everything might be perfectly adjusted.
